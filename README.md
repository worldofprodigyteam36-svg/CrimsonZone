## Content Management

### JSON Format

All content is stored as JSON arrays in the `/data` directory. Each item is a string with bracketed key-value pairs:

```json

  "[name]=\"Example\", [icon]=\"/image/location.png\", [thumbnail]=\"image/location.png\", [file]=\"File/index.html",
]
```

**Fields:**
- `[name]` — Display name of the content
- `[icon]` — Path to icon image
- `[thumbnail]` — Path to thumbnail image
- `[file]` — URL
